description: "We present a dataset of 1809 single neurons  recorded from the human
  medial temporal lobe (amygdala and hippocampus) and medial frontal lobe (anterior
  cingulate cortex, pre-supplementary motor area, ventral medial prefrontal cortex)
  across 41 sessions from 21 patients that underwent intracranial monitoring for epileptic
  activity. Subjects first performed a screening task (907 neurons), based on which
  we identified images for which highly selective cells were present in the medial
  temporal lobe. Subjects then performed a working memory task (902 neurons), in which
  they were sequentially presented with 1-3 images, and following a maintenance period,
  were asked if a probe was identical to one of the currently maintained images. This
  Neural data without borders (NWB) formatted dataset includes spike times, extracellular
  spike waveforms, stimuli presented, behavior, electrode locations, and subject demographics.
  As validation, we replicate previous findings on the existence of concept cells
  and their persistent activity during working memory maintenance.  This dataset provides
  a substantial amount of rare human single neuron recordings together with behavior,
  thereby enabling investigation of the neural mechanisms of working memory at the
  single-neuron level.\n\nSample code to access and analyze this dataset has been
  provided: \nhttps://github.com/rutishauserlab/workingmem-release-NWB\n"
